# Computer Graphics Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of fundamental computer graphics algorithms in C/C++. 
These algorithms are commonly used for drawing basic shapes like lines, circles, and ellipses. Each algorithm is implemented with clear, concise code for easy understanding and integration into your projects.

## Algorithms Included

1. Line Drawing Algorithms:
   - DDA Algorithm
   - Bresenham's Line Algorithm (3A and 3B versions)

2. Circle Drawing Algorithms:
   - Midpoint Circle Algorithm
   - Bresenham's Circle Algorithm

3. Ellipse Drawing Algorithms:
   - Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm
   - Bresenham's Ellipse Algorithm

## How to Use

Each algorithm is contained within its own directory, making it simple to find and utilize. 
Inside each directory, you'll find a well-commented C/C++ source file with the algorithm implementation.

To use any of these algorithms in your project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the algorithm you want to use.
3. Include the respective source file in your project.
4. Call the appropriate function(s) to draw the desired shape.
